Git reset 

==============

This is a command of git using which we can toggle between multiple

versions of git and access whichever version we want



Reset can be done in 3 ways

1 Hard reset

2 soft reset

3 Mixed reset



In hard reset HEAD simply points to an older commit adn we can see the 

data as present at the time of that older commit



1 Create few commits on master

  a-->b--->c



2 To jump to b commit from c

  git reset --hard b_commit_id



------------------------------------------------------------------

Soft reset will also move the head to an older commit but

we will see the condition of the git repository as just one

step prior to the c commit ie the files will be seen in the

stagging area



git reset --soft b_commitid



--------------------------------------------------------------------

Mixed reset also moves the head to an older commit

but we will see the condition of git as 2 steps prior to the c commit

ie the files will be present in the untracked/modified section



git reset --mixed b_commitid
