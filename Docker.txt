MONOLITHIC: SINGLE APP -- > SINGLE SERVER -- > SINGLE DATABASE
MICRO SERVICES: SINGLE APP -- > MULTIPLE SERVERS -- > MULTIPLE DATABASES

MICRO:
COST WILL BE HIGH
MAINTAINANCE


LIMITATIONS OF MONLITHIC:
1. SERVER PERFOMANCE


CONTAINERS:
SERVER = CONTAINER

Containers will not have os by default.
cant able to install pacakages
cant able to deploy the app.

images: inside the image we have os and packages

image (os) -- > conatiner (app)

VIRTUALIZATION: process of utilizing hardware resources in better.
CONTAINERIZATION: process of packing application with its dependencies
APP: PUBG DEPENDENCY: MAPS

PUBG:
APP: PLAYSTORE MAPS: INTERNET

DOCKER:
its a free and open-source platform.
docker will create containers.
we can create, run, and deploy our apps on containers.
its platform independent (native runs on Linux Distribution).
containers will use host resources (cpu, mem, ram, os)
docker will perform os level of VIRTUALIZATION called containerization.

ARCHITECTURE:
DOCKER CLIENT: its a way of interacting with docker (command -- > op)
DOCKER DAEMON: it manage all the docker components (images, cont, volumes, nlw)
DOCKER HOST: where we installed docker
DOCKER REGISTRY: it manages all the  docker images on internet.


INSTALLATION:
yum install docker -y
systemctl start docker
systemctl status docker


docker pull amazonlinux		: to downlaod image
docker run -it --name cont1 amazonlinux : to create conatiner

yum install git -y
yum install maven -y
touch file1
